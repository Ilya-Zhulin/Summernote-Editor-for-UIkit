# Summernote-Editor-for-UIkit
Fork of Summernote Editor project (https://github.com/summernote/summernote) transferred to UIkit framework (http://github.com/uikit/uikit)
A day I was need simple and fast editor for my Uikit site. Native Uikit HTML editor too simple for a while - but we wait it :). 
So, I knew about Summernote from using BS, and I decided to transfer it to Uikit. It's not so easy as I expected, but result is nice :).
